# LIST OF LESSONS
*Linear Regression
- Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables, typically referred to as the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y). It aims to find the linear equation that best describes the relationship between these variables.
- The equation takes the form Y = aX + b, where "a" is the slope of the line (indicating the rate of change of Y with respect to changes in X) and "b" is the intercept (indicating the value of Y when X is zero).
